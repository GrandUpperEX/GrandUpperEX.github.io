### Introduction

These are the best games i played this year in no particular order.
Top 5 are marked by a *

### Streets Of Rage 4 *

A long awaited sequel to one of the best games of all time with an absolutely banging soundtrack and artstyle to boot. This is a great way to hang out with friends or keep the younger family members entertained over the holiday season with up to 4 players on the same system or 2 players online.

### Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge *

Spiritual sequel to TMNT Turtles In Time and it lives up to that and then some. This is truly a great way to hang out with friends or keep the younger family members entertained over the holiday season with up to 6 players on the same system & online.

### Marvel Vs Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics

A truly long awaited collection of one of the best fighting game series with great online and offline play. Get your friends or family members around this and the fun will only stop when someone gets salty after getting hit with an infinite combo.

### Vampire Survivors *

A simple yet oh so satisfying time sink for when you only have a short amount of time to play something, the more time you put into this the more you will want to play it.

### Hades II *

An amazing experience all around, though some patches definitely made the certain weapons worse it has since been more than made up for with The Olympic Update. This is my most played game this year with 230 hours at the time of writing.

### Doom I+II

[Doom I+II Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4-xswoPRpo)

An amazing re-release of two classic games updated with 4K and 120fps support with online co-op to boot which is an absolutely amazing way to experience these two classics though it does make the game slightly more challenging by effectively splitting the ammo pool between all players and not giving each player their own ammo pick ups.

### Borderlands 3 *

[Borderlands 3 Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7mUwX5IPRs)

A great experience with a friend or two, has a much faster pace than previous entries in the series which just adds to the already large amount of fun that the series is known for (Corny writing included). 

### Kitsune Tails

An absolutely challenging SMB3 style platformer with some kaizo style levels thrown in for good measure, don't worry though there is an easy mode for those of you who don't enjoy that kind of challenging gameplay. This game gets a special nod for having some queer representation.

### Special Mentions

Borderlands 2 - Here because it has a slower pace than Borderlands 3 but otherwise a very fun game to play with friends.
Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth - Here because it was slightly too long and overstayed its welcome, also fuck Queens Blood. The combat was fun though.
Final Fantasy XVI - Here because i only played the DLC this year and not the main game. Amazing combat system that only got better the more i played it.
Tekken 8 - Here because the game got worse over time but was great when it came out.
Cuphead - Here and not in the main list simply because i haven't finished it yet, maybe in the Christmas break or New Year.
Monster Hunter Rise - Here and not in the main list because i haven't finished it yet, despite it being a very fun game to play with friends.
Silent Hill 2 Remake - Only here and not in the main list because of a stuttering issue that left me with a migraine, otherwise a great game.
